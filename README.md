Personal Finance Assistant
🚀 Project Overview
This is a single-file, responsive web application built with React that serves as a personal finance assistant. The app is designed to help users manage their finances through an interactive chatbot, a budget calculator, and a financial goal tracker. The entire application is self-contained within a single React component, making it lightweight and easy to deploy.

✨ Features
Interactive Chatbot: A simple, rule-based chatbot provides instant financial advice on topics such as saving, budgeting, debt, and investing. The responses are tailored based on the user's profile (student or professional).

Budget Calculator: A utility to help users track their income and expenses, calculate their monthly leftover income, and determine their savings rate.

Financial Goal Tracker: A tool to help users set and track progress toward financial goals, providing a progress bar and motivational messages.

Responsive Design: The application is fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

🛠️ Technologies Used
React: The core JavaScript library for building the user interface.

Vite: The build tool used to create and run the project.

Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid and consistent styling. All styles are included inline within the component.

Lucide React: A set of beautiful and customizable open-source icons used throughout the interface.
